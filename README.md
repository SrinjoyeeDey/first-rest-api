📦 My First RESTful API 🚀

Welcome to my very first RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and EJS!
This project was created as part of my learning journey into full-stack web development, backend concepts, and server-side rendering.

✨ Why This Project?

I built this project to:

Understand how RESTful APIs work.

Practice CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Learn how to use Express.js for routing.

Get hands-on experience with EJS templates for views.

Build the foundation for real-world, production-ready APIs.
